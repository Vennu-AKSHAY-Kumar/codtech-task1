Project Description: Simple Calculator in Java
Overview: This project is a simple command-line calculator implemented in Java. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as exponentiation (squaring a number). The calculator takes user input for two numbers and the desired operation, providing immediate feedback with the results.

Features:

Basic Arithmetic Operations:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division (with error handling for division by zero)
Power Operation:

Allows the user to square either of the two input numbers.
User Input:

The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and select an operation from a menu.
Input Validation:

The calculator checks for division by zero and ensures that the user selects valid options for operations and enhancements.
Clear Output:

The results of the operations are displayed clearly, showing the mathematical expression and the computed result.
Technologies Used:

Java (JDK)
Java Standard Library (for Scanner to handle user input)
Target Audience: This project is aimed at beginner Java programmers who are learning about basic programming concepts, user input handling, conditional statements, and mathematical operations. It can also serve as a foundational project for those looking to develop more complex applications in the future.

Usage Instructions:

Compile the Java program using a Java Development Kit (JDK).
Run the compiled program in a command-line environment.
Follow the prompts to enter two numbers and choose an operation.
View the result of the calculation displayed in the console.
Future Enhancements:

Extend functionality to include more advanced mathematical operations (e.g., square root, logarithms).
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for improved user interaction.
Add support for more complex expressions using parentheses and operator precedence.
Include input history for previous calculations.
